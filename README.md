# joinhands

A fun party game?

A bunch of people randomly join hands until no hands are free.  How many groups are formed, and how big are they?

It turns out that you are equally likely to end up in a group of any size.

This implementation ignores spatial distribution of people, i.e, assumes any two people are equally likely to join hands.
